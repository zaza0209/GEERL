Dear Area Chair,

We appreciate the opportunity to submit our work and address the reviewers' feedback. Below is a summary of the situation, particularly regarding the 1-point review:

The reviewer who gave a score of 1 with a confidence of 4 primarily raised concerns about the writing quality of the paper, stating that it affects readability. While we acknowledge that writing clarity is important, this is a relatively minor issue that can be easily addressed. In fact, through this rebuttal process, we have already identified specific ways to improve the presentation and have committed to making targeted revisions to enhance the paper's readability.

However, it is important to emphasize that the paperâ€™s primary value lies in its **novelty and contributions**, not its initial writing style. The comments raised by this reviewer, while addressable, do not seem to justify the extremely low score. None of the comments fundamentally undermine the technical soundness, theoretical contributions, or practical relevance of the work. In contrast, other reviewers have recognized the significance of integrating GEE into RL and the potential impact of the proposed method.

We hope that the improvements we have outlined in the rebuttal, particularly addressing all reviewers' concerns about clarity and presentation, will sufficiently demonstrate the value of our work. We respectfully ask that the score from this reviewer be carefully reconsidered in light of the minor nature of their concerns compared to the substantive contributions of the paper.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for overseeing the review process. We remain committed to improving the manuscript further should it be accepted. 

Best regards,  
Authors
