Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback and for increasing your score to 2. We appreciate your acknowledgment of the clarifications provided in our rebuttal.

We would like to clarify that the concerns raised regarding writing clarity and presentation, while important, are not critical issues that affect the core contributions of our work. As mentioned, we have already developed a comprehensive plan to address these concerns during the revision process. Specifically, we will:

1. **Add a subsection at the beginning of the paper** to introduce symbols and definitions, enhancing clarity for readers.
2. **Remove some non-essential content** to free up space within the 9-page limit, allowing us to present the complete theoretical conditions and results.
3. **Provide more detailed descriptions of the real-world data** we use, to improve understanding and relevance.

These changes will focus on improving the presentation without altering the core algorithm or model, which remains unchanged. We believe these revisions will address your concerns and further strengthen the paper's communication of its contributions.

Thank you again for your constructive feedback.
