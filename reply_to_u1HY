Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback and for increasing your score to 2. We appreciate your acknowledgment of the clarifications provided in our rebuttal.

We have already developed a comprehensive plan to address these concerns during the revision process. Specifically, we will:

1. **Add a subsection at the beginning of the paper** to introduce symbols and definitions, such as the defintion of the value function and regret, enhancing clarity for readers.
2. **Remove some non-essential content** to free up space within the 9-page limit, allowing us to present the complete theoretical conditions and results (see e.g., our reponse to the second point of your comments on Clarity).
3. **Provide more detailed descriptions of the real-world data** we use, to improve understanding and relevance (see our reponse to the third and forth points of your comments on Clarity and on Significance Justification).
4. **Highlight the contribution** The integration of generalized estimating equations (GEE), a classical statistical tool for longitudinal and clustered data, into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework is unconventional. This approach bridges the gap between statistical methods for correlated data and modern RL techniques, addressing a unique set of challenges rarely explored in RL literature.

 
We also wanted to bring your attention that writing clarity and presentation, while important, are not critical issues that affect the core contributions of our work. These changes will focus on improving the presentation without altering the core algorithm or model, which remains unchanged. 
We believe these revisions will address your concerns and further strengthen the paper's communication of its contributions.

Additionally, we have provided a comprehensive reply ranging from theoretical aspects to empirical results and other concerns, and we are glad to know that your concerns regarding those are addressed. Regarding the concern about presentation, we have come up with a plan and we believe this is not so critical.

Thank you again for your constructive feedback.
